minesweeper.py

This README provides an overview and instructions for using the code contained in the associated file. The file includes a function named 'minesweep' that takes a minefield as input and performs a minesweeping operation on it. Each section of the code is described below along with an example of how to use it.

Function: minesweep
The 'minesweep' function performs a minesweeping operation on a given minefield. It iterates through each cell in the minefield and determines the number of adjacent mines for each empty cell. The function modifies the minefield by assigning the count of adjacent mines or a question mark to each cell. Finally, it prints the updated minefield.

Parameters
minefield: A 2D list representing the minefield. Each cell can contain one of the following characters:
"#" represents a mine
"-" represents an empty cell
Usage
To use the 'minesweep' function, follow these steps:

Create a sample minefield by defining a 2D list, where "#" represents a mine and "-" represents an empty cell.
Call the 'minesweep' function, passing the sample minefield as the input.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Create a sample minefield
minefield = [
    ["#", "-", "-", "-"],
    ["-", "-", "-", "#"],
    ["#", "-", "#", "#"],
    ["-", "#", "-", "-"],
    ["-", "-", "-", "-"]
]

# Call the 'minesweep' function on the sample minefield
minesweep(minefield)
Output
The function will print the updated minefield, where the empty cells are replaced with the count of adjacent mines and other cells are assigned a question mark.

Output:

css
Copy code
['#', '1', '0', '0']
['2', '3', '2', '#']
['#', '3', '#', '#']
['2', '#', '4', '2']
['1', '2', '2', '1']
Notes
The 'minesweep' function modifies the original minefield in-place.
The function counts the number of adjacent mines for each empty cell and assigns the count as a string to the cell.
If a cell is neither a mine nor an empty cell, it is assigned a question mark.
The function prints the minefield after the minesweeping operation is performed.
